  <h2>Intoduction:</h2>
  <p>Well, you see Life is much a finite pursuit of discovery and seek of truth. We humans curious as always can't stop our inevitable lust for questionning our own purpose, maybe some of us give up easily and pretent like they didn't have a choice or something, but this is just my opinion so it doesn't realy matter. I had severe depression for months let along years of constant anexiety, the question is : WHY?
  the answer is simple: Fear of The Future, sometimes you don't get to see yourself as someone who could lead a life, get a job, get married, have kids you know, and all what your mind thinks about is how to end it all. But, can we really end it all, does ending someone's life really the end?? or maybe the start of something worse? You see, all what we know is just what we were forced to know either by our parents, environment, medias and else... 
  Does that mean, all what we know until now is just a reflection of what we didn't get to choose to know but had to? Seems weird right? Well it gets way creepier when you overthink about it! Thinking inside the BOX! But what BOX? is there really a BOX? and the one who came up with the BOX idea wasn't he doing the same? A lot of questions to ask but we literally leave it to our lifespan to decide for us hehe, we could die before even knowing the truth.
  After all, do we really need to know the truth? can't we just live and mind our own businesses? wouldn't that be more peaceful and less controversial? well that's just an opion. I could be right or wrongs, maybe both it's up to u to decide</p>
